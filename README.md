# Portfolio Simulation Project

This project tracks a simulated ₹10 lakh equity portfolio invested across 10 different Indian stocks.

The simulation will run for at least 6 months.  
- Month 1: Passive observation — no rebalancing, just tracking performance  
- Month 2 onwards: Weekly updates including rebalancing, stock exits/entries, and strategy changes

**Note:** For now, portfolio allocation assumes fractional shares for simplicity. Will switch to whole-share constraints later based on real market prices.

## Structure
- Week_1/: Stock selection, initial allocation, notes
- logs/: Weekly logs and rationale for changes
- summary/: Monthly summaries and performance overview

## Tools
- Excel (allocation & tracking)
- GitHub (version control, documentation)

## Future Goals
- Gain practical understanding of portfolio management
- Possibly automate parts of this using Python later on
